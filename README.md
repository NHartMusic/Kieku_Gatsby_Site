This is a site created for pitching purposes for Kieku Records' planned Music Tech division. The initial product being pitched is a plugin that will operate as a composition tool, giving producers and composers suggestions as they play midi notes, telling them what kinds of chords can be built around those notes in any given scale. Eventually the goal is to work towards a plugin that utilizes artificial intelligence to create its own music. 

There is more info within the site about what the tool will entail, and what future stages of development will entail. This site was built by audio engineer and software developer Nick Hart, who is overseeing all technical details of this project, and will eventually become CTO of this division of Kieku after product launch. 

This site was built using Gatsby.js, which naturally includes React and GraphQL in its tech stack. Additional technologies used here include Styled Components and Typescript. To run the project, simply download, install all dependencies, and run 'gatsby develop' in your terminal.
